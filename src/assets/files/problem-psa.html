<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>
  In the world of pokemon, where the user should be able to search for different
  pokemons, you have to create an application to search them with the following
  functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Pokemon application should have the list of pokemon details which will
    be provided in the form of JSON data i.e., it should have name, image, CP,
    attack, defense type etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    It should have a search bar so that user can search the pokemon based on the
    name of pokemon.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since we have many pokemon, apply pagination, so that user can only see 10
    pokemon at a time.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Pagination should have 'page current-page of Total pages'. For example: page
    50 of 100
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The total pages should be calculated based on the JSON data provided.
    </li>
    <li>
      And the current page is calculated based on the page, the user is in,
      currently.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pagination should have id='pagination', which should contain the details
      as listed above.
    </li>
    <li>
      The previous button should be disabled if it is in the first page and it
      should have id='previous'.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next button, should show next set of pokemon (which is 10 pokemon on a
      click) and should have id='next'.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Search bar should have an id='search'.</li>
  <li>
    Pokemon's name should be inside the span tag (or any other tag) which should
    have id='name'.
  </li>
</ul>
