<p><strong>Step 1 : Install the necessary dependencies</strong><br/>
Install the following libraries using npm
<ul><li>react-router-dom : enable routing in React</li>
<li>react-redux : enable redux for state management in Redux</li>
<li>react-redux-thunk : enable redux with asynchronous ability (for CRUD using Redux)</li>
<li>axios : make API calls</li>
<li>bootstrap : enable RWD (responsive web design)</li></ul>
<code>npm i react-router-dom react-redux redux redux-thunk axios bootstrap</code><br/>
Create the react app by entering the following in terminal<br/>
<code>npx create-react-app event-finder-app</code></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 : Project Folder Structure</strong><br/>
In the src folder, create the folders, subfolders and subfolders in the following structure<br/>
<ul><li>event_module</li>
<ul><li>components</li>
<ol><li>add_event.js : form with logic to create an event</li>
<li>credits.js : attribute links for pictures used</li>
<li>navbar.js : navbar with routing links</li>
<li>page_default.js : link to navbar component</li>
<li>search_event.js : logic to find events by ID, date & venue, with options to update & delete</li>
<li>show_events.js : logic to display events with pagination options</li>
<li>update_event.js: form with logic to update an event</li></ol>
<li>database_files</li>
<ol><li>events.json : data for dummy API for CRUD</li></ol>
<li>redux</li>
<ol><li>actions</li>
<ol><li>event_actions.js : function definitions to implement CRUD methods</li>
<li>event_methods.js : methods with types & payloads</li>
<li>event_types.js : types of events</li></ol>
<li>reducers</li>
<ol><li>combine_reducer.js : combine all reducers</li>
<li>event_reducer.js : reducer function for different types of API calls</li></ol>
<li>store.js : configure redux store with reducer parameters & apply thunk middleware</li></ol>
<li>services</li>
<ol><li>event-services.js : API URLs & functions</li></ol></ul></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 : Launch React App</strong><br/>
Launch the React app on default port (3000) by entering the following in terminal<br/>
<code>npm start</code>
launch the link localhost:3000 in a new browser</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 : Launch JSON server</strong><br/>
Setup json server to serve the database json file on port 4000, as 3000 is in use by React<br/>
<code>json-server --watch .\src\user_defined\database_files\events.json --port 4000</code><br/>
import bootstrap css & bootstrap bundle in app.js to enable bootstrap<br/>
<code>import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';</code>
<code>import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min';</code>

<p><strong>Step 5 : Configure Redux Store & logic for State Management</strong><br/>
Add the store as a provider for App.js which contains the logic for all the components to display 
in the browser. This will enable state management in all the components referenced in App.js and below (children).<br/>
<strong><u>Configure Event Actions</u></strong><br>
Add the API URL of the fake API (json server) to the environment variables. Enter the API calls for 
different CRUD methods in event-services.js, which will connect the buttons in the application to the 
different CRUD methods like get (retrieve data), post (send data), put (update data) & delete (delete data). 
Enter the different event action types for the reducer function. Also add the mapToProps constant which
will update the state of the component for each method call in each component. Add the event methods with 
data types and payloads for the reducer function. Whatever option is matched in the switch function of the 
reducer to the event types will return the respective payload. The event actions will map the data type and 
payload to the axios API methods mentioned in event_services.js and dispatch it to the store, where the state 
is updated and retrieved in the components accordingly<br/>
<strong><u>Configure Event Reducers</u></strong><br/>
Create a reducer function which sets the initial state as an empty array (multiple values) and uses a
switch function to match event types to event_actions.js & event_methods.js to return the state (if
required) and the respective data payload. If there are multiple reducer functions for different tasks, like 
authorization/login then combine_reducer combines all the reducer functions into a single reducer function which 
can be used to create the store<br/>
<strong><u>Configure Redux Store</u></strong><br/>
create the store with thunk middleware using the combine reducer</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 : Configure Components (view logic)</strong><br/>
page_default.js contains the business logic to display the navbar.<br/>
<strong><u>Navbar</u></strong><br/>
Logic to display the navbar with the selected component information<br/>
<strong><u>Create</u></strong><br/>
Use forms to send the data to the API server with connect to connect to the redux store and bootstrap
classes for RWD. The function createEvent along with other functions to be executed during runtime can
be attached as onClick button events, which have to be bound to the functions to reflect changes
without reverting.<br/>
<strong><u>Read</u></strong><br/>
the data to be read or retrieved and displayed in browser is in the form of an array, hence using index
and pagination with a list mapping will allow displaying the data in a neat and arranged manner
(aesthetically pleasing).<br/>
<strong><u>Find/Search</u></strong><br/>
Create the logic to search by ID, date & venue, depending on the option chosen by utilizing dropdown.
The data retrieved will be an object in case of ID & array (single or multiple lines) in case of venue or
date. If statement can be used to match the data to the presentation format. For each record displayed,
there is an update and delete button.<br/>
<strong><u>Update</u></strong><br/>
If the update button is clicked, then the logic redirects the user to the update page, where the data in
the current record is shown in a fixed box, with blank fields for the data to be updated.<br/>
<strong><u>Delete</u></strong><br/>
The delete logic is contained in search_event.js, when the delete button is clicked, the respective
function is called in event_methods.js.<br/>
